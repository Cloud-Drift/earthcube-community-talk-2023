## Takeaways

* Lagrangian data analysis is difficult
* Existing libraries largely designed for gridded data analysis
* CloudDrift is a new Python library that accelerates the use of Lagrangian
  data for Earth Sciences by providing
  * Easy access to cloud-optimized data
  * User-friendly analysis and transformation functions
  * A framework to package custom Lagrangian data into a cloud-ready format
